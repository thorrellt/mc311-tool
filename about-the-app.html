            <h3>The MC311 Note Tool</h3>
            <p>Montgomery County, Maryland&apos;s 311 phone number (known simply as MC311) serves as the main entry
                point for residents to access public information and government services. This application was built to
                help increase the speed and efficiency that the representatives from MC311 can access information and
                handle calls. This is primarily done by generating fleshed out notes based on minimal user inputs, and
                aggregating commonly accessed data. The idea is that reducing the redundancies associated with this job
                would help representatives assist more residents.</p>

            <h3>General tips for users</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The next input field can be jumped to by hitting tab, including the copy button
                    <button id="about-copy-btn" type="" class="btn btn-primary" disabled>
                        <i class="bi bi-clipboard me-1"></i></button>
                    The less time one uses the mouse to navigate, the faster they will move.
                </li>
                <li>When the copy button is highlighted by tabbing to it, notes can be copied with spacebar, or the
                    Enter key. You can
                    also click this button with your mouse, though this is not recommended.</li>
                <li>In the &quot;Ride On Arrival&quot; section, if the Minutes field is left blank, or filled with â€œ0,
                    the notes
                    will adjust for a bus arriving at any moment.</li>
                <li>On the &quot;DEP Inspection&quot; section, if the contact ID is left blank, or filled with
                    &quot;0&quot;, the notes will
                    adjust to a transfer to a DPS specialist</li>
