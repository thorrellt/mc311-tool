            <p>This was my first project after learning Bootstrap 5. It served as a chance to reinforce what I learned
                about
                Bootstrap, as well as good practice with working with the DOM and maninpulating objects and arrays in
                JaveScript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mx-5">
            <p>The basic idea leveraged common functions, like copying data to the clipboard, updating the users
                display,
                and building list. From there I built functions to generate & format the proper data and notes, and
                passed
                them.</p>

            <p>Some sections were fairly straight forward, simply grabbing user inputs, and forming a string around them
            </p>

            <p>Some required accompanying data to build the notes for the user, or provide them information. All data
                was stored in objects, some nested (like the stop ID locator.)</p>
