# MC 311 Notes Tool
  
  
Montgomery County, Maryland's 311 phone number (known simply as MC311) serves as the main entry point for residents to access public information and government services. This application was built to help increase the speed and efficiency that the representatives from MC311 can access information and handle calls. This is primarily done by generating fleshed out notes based on minimal user inputs, and aggregating commonly accessed data. The idea is that reducing the redundancies associated with this job would help representatives assist more residents.

## Key Takeaways

**Bootstrap 5:** This was my first solo project using Bootstrap 5 framework. It served as great practice using the class based Bootstrap approach to building a responsive website. 

**JavaScript Data Structure Manipulation:** All of the data for this project is stored in JS objects, array, ro combinations of both. This provided plenty of practice manipulating JS data structures using their inherent methods.

**Leveraging User Feedback:** I utilized peer/user to correct overlooked bugs, and better design the tool to cover a broader range of needs. As much as my peers have thanked me for building this tool, I am just as thankful for thier input.

## If I Revisited This Project, 
#### I Would...

-   Update the look of the site, as it is fairly generic. 

-   Add a Dark Mode

-   Search for an API to integrate to expand on the public transportation funtionalities.
